        Depending on busybox or coreutils package version
        on target platform the "timeout" command either
        will take "timeout -t 5 ..." or "timeout 5 ...".

        Enable this if "timeout -t 5 ..." works on your platform.

        Disable this if "timeout 5 ..." works on your platform.

        We introduced new tag "wps" to PSK file. That tag is used
        for marking PSKs usable in WPS sessions.

        This feature is dependent on the below upstream hostap commit
        which recognizes this tag.

            commit fde8e7946304569292c5d520d76371291cc4f88c

            WPS: Make it possible to use PSKs loaded from the PSK file.

        Enable this only on platforms using hostap patched with above commit.

config HOSTAP_WPA_SUPPLICANT_GLOBAL_PATH
    string "WPA supplicant global path"
    default "/var/run/wpa_supplicantglobal"
    help
        Specify WPA supplicant global path, which depends on wpad.init in hostapd package.

        In openwrt hostapd opensource community, it is set as /var/run/wpa_supplicant/global by default.
        https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/blob/master/package/network/services/hostapd/files/wpad.init#L30

        As WPA supplicant global path might be customized in wpad.init by SDK, it is suggeested to make it
        configurable by opensync kconfig to match the customized path.
