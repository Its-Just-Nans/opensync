config OSP_DL_NULL
    bool "Null"
    help
        This backend implements a dummy implementation of the osp_dl API. All
        functions in this implementation return an error.

config OSP_DL_CURL
    bool "cURL"
    help
        This backend provides a cURL based osp_DL API implementation.

        Note: cURL to be fully asynchronous must be compiled with c-ares
        support. Otherwise it will use the system resolver which may block on
        DNS quieries.
