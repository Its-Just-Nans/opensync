        This process is intended to handle all Wireless

        configurations, report states, steering clients,

                help
                    RSNO support is compiled in with WPA3 compatibility mode.
                    This will automatically remove non-PSK AKMs from RSNE and
                    move them to RSNO1 and RSNO2 as per WFA WPA spec.

                    This is the most conservative option. It will result in
                    downgrading older WPA3 clients to use PSK instead of SAE
                    when connecting to AP where RSNO is enabled.

                    This is intended mostly for Wi-Fi 7 platforms for
                    interoperability purposes.

                    Keep in mind this will have an effect on WPA3-Personal
                    Transition non-Wi-Fi 7 platforms too as it will move SAE to
                    RSNO1, and keep PSK in RSNE only.

            config OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT_TRANSITION
                bool "WPA3 compatibility transition mode"
                help
                    Just like OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT except RSNE is allowed
                    to contain PSK+SAE AKMs to avoid degrading security
                    properties for WPA3 devices that aren't RSNO aware.

                    This is least conservative option compared to
                    OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT as it should not result in WPA3
                    clients being downgraded to WPA2.

                    This doesn't fulfill the WFA WPA spec's definition of WPA3
                    Compatibility Mode though, but complies with RSNO itself.

            config OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT_WIFI7_ONLY
                bool "WPA3 compatibility mode for WiFi7 only"
                help
                    Just like OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT except the split is done
                    only if RSNE AKM is intended to include SAE-EXT.

                    This is a middle-ground option between
                    OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT and
                    OW_CORE_RSNO_WPA3_COMPAT_TRANSITION. It applies the
                    transformation only on Wi-Fi 7 APs where SAE-EXT is
                    required for EHT+MLO. APs that have no SAE-EXT will not
                    have their real RSNE changed.
