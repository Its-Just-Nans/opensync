            Independent part of WANO ethernet client detection plugin that is able
            to speedup IPv6 connectivity of some ethernet IPv6 clients that may give up
            sending router solicitation messages before the port is eventually added
            into the bridge. It works in the following way: When the port is added
            into the bridge, it artificially sends a RS message (via rdisc6).
            Since the router typically responds with a RA to an unicast address,
            such a RA message is then rewritten to be sent to a multicast address
            of all-nodes. Thus, the IPv6 client, even if it gave up sending RS too
            early, will then receive such a RA and will not have to wait for a periodic RA.
