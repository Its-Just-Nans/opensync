# Checks if BSS is up by execution of platform-specific scripts,
# but there are multiple exceptions to such simple check; this script handles
# those exceptions using platform-agnostic tools.

#   1. All channels are in NOP state
#   2. Radio is misconfigured (e.g. channel is not set)
#   3. Other VIF in the same MLD group is up
